# Data Imputation Repository

This repository contains various code implementations for data imputation techniques. Data imputation is the process of replacing missing or incomplete data in a dataset with substituted values. The goal of this repository is to provide reusable code and demonstrate several methods for imputing missing data.

## Available Techniques

- **Mean/Median/Mode Imputation**: Filling missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the column.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Imputation based on the similarity of other data points.
- **Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)**: A sophisticated approach that models the missing data in multiple stages.
- **Regression Imputation**: Using regression models to predict and fill missing values.
